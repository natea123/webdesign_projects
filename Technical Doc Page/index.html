                        Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing 
                        containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative 
                        configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. 
                        Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

                        The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. 
                        Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes builds upon 
                        a decade and a half of experience that Google has with running production 
                        workloads at scale, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the 
                        community.

                            A node is a worker machine in Kubernetes, previously known as a minion. A node may be a 
                            VM or physical machine, depending on the cluster. Each node contains the services 
                            necessary to run pods and is managed by the master components. The services on a node 
                            include the container runtime, kubelet and kube-proxy.

                        <p>A Pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers 
                        (such as Docker containers), with shared storage/network, and a specification for 
                        how to run the containers. A Pod’s contents are always co-located and co-scheduled, 
                        and run in a shared context. A Pod models an application-specific “logical host” - it 
                        contains one or more application containers which are relatively tightly coupled — in a 
                        pre-container world, being executed on the same physical or virtual machine would mean being 
                        executed on the same logical host.
                        </p>
                        <p>Containers within a Pod share an IP address and port space, and can find each other via localhost. 
                        They can also communicate with each other using standard inter-process communications like SystemV 
                        semaphores or POSIX shared memory. Containers in different Pods have distinct IP addresses and can 
                        not communicate by IPC without special configuration. These containers usually communicate with each 
                        other via Pod IP addresses.

                        A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its 
                        dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment 
                        to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of 
                        software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, 
                        system libraries and settings.</p>
                        <p>
                            Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers - images 
                            become containers when they run on Docker Engine. Available for both Linux and Windows-based 
                            applications, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure. 
                            Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite 
                            differences for instance between development and staging.

                            In Kubernetes, a Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which 
                            to access them (sometimes this pattern is called a micro-service). The set of Pods targeted by a Service 
                            is usually determined by a selector
