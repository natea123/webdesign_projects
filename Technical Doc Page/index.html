                <p>Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing 
                   containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative 
                   configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. 
                   Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.</p>
                <p>The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. 
                   Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes builds upon 
                   a decade and a half of experience that Google has with running production 
                   workloads at scale, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the 
                   community.

                <p>
                   A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its 
                   dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment 
                   to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of 
                   software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, 
                   system libraries and settings.</p>
                <p>
                    Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers - images 
                    become containers when they run on Docker Engine. Available for both Linux and Windows-based 
                    applications, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure. 
                    Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite 
                    differences for instance between development and staging.
